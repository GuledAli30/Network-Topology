## Benefits of this Network Topology

### Scalability
- The design includes modular switches which can be easily expanded as the network grows.
- New nodes can be added with minimal impact on the existing network, ensuring seamless scaling.

### Redundancy
- The use of multiple paths between critical nodes ensures that there is no single point of failure.
- Redundant connections between the core switches and access switches provide failover capabilities.

### Security
- The diagram highlights segregated network zones, ensuring that sensitive data is protected.
- Firewalls are placed between the public and private segments, preventing unauthorized access.
- Intrusion detection systems are strategically located to monitor and respond to potential threats.

# 🏢 Small Office Network Topology

## 📜 **Project Description**

This project outlines the design and implementation of a **basic network topology for a small office setup**. The network is designed to ensure **scalability, redundancy, and security** while maintaining simplicity and manageability.

## 🚀 **Objectives**

- **Establish a reliable network infrastructure** for a small office.
- **Ensure secure and efficient connectivity** for all office devices.
- **Incorporate redundancy** to minimize downtime.
- **Design a scalable network** that can grow with the office needs.

## 🖥️ **Network Components**

1. **Internet Connection** 🌐
2. **Firewall** 🔥
3. **Router** 📶
4. **Switch** 🔀
5. **Access Points (APs)** 📡
6. **Servers** 🖥️
7. **Workstations** 💻
8. **Printers & Peripherals** 🖨️

## 📈 **Network Design**

### **1. Internet and Perimeter Security**
- **ISP Connection**: Provides internet access.
- **Firewall**: Protects the network from external threats.
- **Router**: Connects the internal network to the internet.

### **2. Core Network**
- **Switch**: Central device connecting all wired devices.
- **Servers**: Hosts internal services and applications.
- **Workstations**: Office computers for employees.
- **Access Points**: Provides wireless connectivity.

### **3. Network Segmentation**
- **Office Network VLAN**: For general employee access.
- **Guest Network VLAN**: Isolated network for visitors.
- **Server Network VLAN**: Isolated for server security.
- **VPN for Remote Access**: Secure connection for remote workers.

### **4. Redundancy**
- **Redundant Switch**: Backup switch for failover.
- **Dual Internet Connections**: Secondary internet connection for reliability.
- **UPS for Critical Devices**: Uninterruptible power supply for essential network components.

### **5. Security Measures**
- **Configure Firewall**: Set up strict rules to block unauthorized access.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Control traffic flow on switches and routers.
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**: Monitor and prevent suspicious activities.
- **Regular Updates and Patching**: Keep all devices and servers updated.
- **Strong Password Policies**: Implement robust password requirements.
- **Network Monitoring**: Tools to monitor performance and detect anomalies.
