## Benefits of this Network Topology

### Scalability
- The design includes modular switches which can be easily expanded as the network grows.
- New nodes can be added with minimal impact on the existing network, ensuring seamless scaling.

### Redundancy
- The use of multiple paths between critical nodes ensures that there is no single point of failure.
- Redundant connections between the core switches and access switches provide failover capabilities.

### Security
- The diagram highlights segregated network zones, ensuring that sensitive data is protected.
- Firewalls are placed between the public and private segments, preventing unauthorized access.
- Intrusion detection systems are strategically located to monitor and respond to potential threats.
